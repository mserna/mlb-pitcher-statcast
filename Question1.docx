Why do you want to work in professional baseball? What parts of this environment are
attractive to you? How do you think you can help the Angels?

I love baseball. I have been playing and following the sport since I was kid. 
I have been an Angels fan for even longer, growing up in Tustin and 20 minutes from Angel stadium,
I grew up watching games with my dad and grandfather. 
The Angels are our team and I have always dreamt of playing professional baseball for them. 
Even though that dream was not fulfilled,
working for the Angels organization would be the closest thing to that.
I since then began studying computer science and found passion in programming and developing applications.
I hope to use my skills and experience to help the Angels organization become a playoff contending ball club. 
I believe in the Angels and given this role, I believe that I can provide 
great work across the team and contribute to our success.
